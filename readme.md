# SQL Server Docker Compose Template üê≥

This Docker Compose template simplifies the process of setting up and running a Microsoft SQL Server instance using Docker. You can quickly spin up a SQL Server container with the configuration specified below.

## Usage

1. **Start SQL Server Container:**
   - Open a terminal in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   This command will pull the SQL Server image and start a container with the specified configuration.

2. **Access SQL Server:**
   - Once the container is running, you can connect to the SQL Server instance using your preferred SQL client.
   - Use the following connection details:
     - **Server:** localhost (or Docker host IP)
     - **Port:** 1433
     - **Authentication:** SQL Server Authentication
     - **Username:** sa
     - **Password:** `<YourStrong@Passw0rd>` (as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file)

3. **Stop and Remove Container:**
   - To stop the SQL Server container, run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
   This command will stop and remove the container, but the data volume will persist unless explicitly removed.

## Customization

- **Password:** Replace `<YourStrong@Passw0rd>` in the `docker-compose.yml` file with your desired SQL Server SA password.
- **Additional Configuration:** Modify other parameters such as environment variables, ports, and volumes as needed.
